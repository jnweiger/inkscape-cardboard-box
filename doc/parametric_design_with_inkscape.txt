Parametric design needs arithmetic terms for many of its dimensions.
These terms compute the dimension after parameters like 
width, height, depth, thickness were input.

Svg files can store arbitrary meta information, but inkscape would not parse
and visualize most of it properly.

The specifiction for a path is 
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataBNF


Idea 1
======

Title and description are available on right clicking an object
and are quite eaily accessible in the svg:
     <a>
      <desc id="desc3763">quadrat-beschreibung</desc>
      <title id="title3761">quadrat-titel</title>
      <rect>
      </rect>
     </a>
     <path style=".." id="path3767"
       d="m 283.46457,177.16529 0,354.33071"
       transform="translate(0,-10.629915)">
      <desc id="desc3769">(2*w, h-t)-(3*w, 2*h+t)</desc>
    </path>


    the description contains a 1:1 mapping to the four values of the d="" 
    attribute. note that subsequent path points in d are relative to the first
    point, but our description may prefer to have all in absolute coordinates.

Each template must have exactly one <rect> with title "Dimensions"
and a description in the form of assignments, one per line. Optionally
follwowed by a list of assertions in pythonic syntax:

	w=12
	h=22
	d=32
	t=1
	assert(w>4)
	assert(min([w,h,d]>=2*t))

Idea 2
======
We use Arrows "with text near to them" for specifying dimensions.
 Arrows pointing horizontally carry an x-coordinate.
 Arrows pointing vertically carry an y-corrdinate.
 Arrows pointing at an angle 10 deg or more slanted, carry an (x,y) pair.

Standard arrows only have one end. These coordinates are absolute.
 Optionally, we may allow arrows with two ends, 
 (pointing in exaclty opposite direction!) these carry relative coordinates.

For all drawn coordinates, matching arrows are searched. 
 an arrow matches a coordinate, if it is drawn at (almost) the same coordinate.
 (use guides to snap).
 If muliple arrows are at the same coodinate, then arrows are matched by color.
